Check out [this tech talk video series](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/brushless-dc-motors.html) to understand: 
  
- How brushless DC motors differ from brushed DC motors and how they work
- How BLDC motors can be controlled using six-step commutation (trapezoidal control)
- The different components of a BLDC motor control algorithm such as PWM control, commutation logic, three-phase inverter and sensor
